Trie Data Structure 


In this project, the SNCB, the famous Belgian railway company, observes longer and longer queues behind each ticket vending machine, yielding frustrating wait times for hurried travelers.  Upon investigating vending machine data, they notice that a significant amount of time is lost, on the one hand, due to spelling mistakes while entering the destination station, and on the other, because the validity check, which happens at each key press, is slow.  Utilizing the right data structures and algorithms and implementing a solid strategy, the problem is successfully solved.
